# patelco

Analyze financial transactions with an eye toward improving personal/
household budgets by reducing unnecessary expenses. Initial
implementation focuses on data from Patelco Credit Union in CSV format.

One goal of this project is to consume data in any of several
industry-standard formats from arbitrary financial institutions,
including Open Financial Exchange Format (\*.ofx); Quicken WebConnect
(\*.qfx); and Quickbooks (\*.qbo).
